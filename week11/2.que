Given a set of available types of coins. Let suppose you have infinite supply of each type of coin.
For a given value $N$, you have to Design an algorithm and implement it using a program to find
number of ways in which these coins can be added to make sum value equals to $N$.
Time Complexity: $O(n*sm)$
Space Complexity: $O(n*sm)$
