Given an already sorted array of positive integers, design an algorithm and implement it using a
program to find whether a given key element is present in the sorted array or not. 
For an array \lstinline{arr[n]}, search at the indexes 
\lstinline{arr[0], arr[2], arr[4],.....,arr[2^k]} and so on.
Once the interval $arr[2^k] < key < arr[2^{k+1}]$ is found,
perform a linear search operation from the index $2^k$ to find the element key. 
(Complexity $< O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements need to be scanned 
for searching)
