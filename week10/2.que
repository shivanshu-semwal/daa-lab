Given a long list of tasks. Each task takes specific time to accomplish it and each task has a
deadline associated with it. You have to design an algorithm and implement it using a program to
find maximum number of tasks that can be completed without crossing their deadlines and also
find list of selected tasks.
Time Complexity: $O(nlogn)$
Space Complexity: $O(1)$
