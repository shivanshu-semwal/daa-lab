Given an unsorted array of elements, design an algorithm and implement it using a program to
find whether majority element exists or not. Also find median of the array. A majority element is
an element that appears more than $n/2$ times, where $n$ is the size of array.
Time Complexity: $O(n\log{n})$
Space Complexity: $O(1)$
